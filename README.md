# book-directory-api
RESTful API built using MongoDB, Express, and Node.js that functions as a personal book directory to keep track of what books I have and have not read, amongst other things.

## How to Install:
1. Clone this repository anywhere you like
2. Make sure you have node.js and MongoDB installed properly
3. Navigate into the `book-directory-api` directory and type `npm install`
4. Start MongoDB service in a separate terminal
5. Type `npm run start` while still in the same directory
6. API should be up and running :)
